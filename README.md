Hello world =)
Welcome to my portfolio. This repo contains a quick showcase of languages I work along with the usual resume to view and download as PDF which naturally include my work experience.
It was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Its is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap and some wow/animate.css ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
 
## UX (User Experience)
 This website is desigened to be responsive on a range of devices which is smooth to navigate for potential recruiters/customers and it showcases a developers skills, the main focus for the website’s owner is to present his knowledge in developing and manifest digital ideas to reality.
 Potential customers can request projects such as fully responsive front-end static website’s with the addition of back-end functionality, another project can be a mobile application as well.

- ### User stories

  - As a website user or as a recruiter, I want to effortlessly understand the main purpose of the website & understand more about what the developer is offering.
  - To be able to effortlessly navigate throughout the website to find the right content.
  - To be able to find information about the projects.
  - To be able to contact with the developer for any inquires.
  - To be able to see my picture that connectes the user with me and brings friendliness to the website.
  - To be able to know about the background of the developer.
  - To be able to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine the developers echo across the web.

- ### Design

  - #### Image

    - So I was debating between putting my picture in the hero body or not, But after I asked my friends and got random feedback from them, plus I searched online and realized that is what people really wanted to see as well in a portfolio and to just get to know me more as a person.
      And nowadays as almost 85% of jobs are applied online, where usually there's no opportunity to physically present my face in front of recruiters at the company, the picture really helps.
      So I reluctantly added my picture to the hero-body. We live in an age with no people judgments can form just based on gender, age and ethnicity, So I'm happy it's there and I hope you like it.

  - #### Color:

    - The color used are colormap linear gradient of the color schemes purple, white and blue and at most of the design purple is the color progression dominant.
      I choose the color purple because it's often assosiated with wisdom, creativity and magic.Purple as well is the balancing color between red and blue’s color psychologies, and while red brings energy to the color, blue brings relaxation and stability, together they make purple the perfect balance of the two.
      [Color Psychology](http://www.artitudesdesign.com/purple-color-psychology/) says that it “can have calming effects over the mind and nerves, it can be uplifting and can trigger creativity.”

  - #### Typography
    - The sexy fonts used within the website are Exo and Roboto fonts. Sans Serif font is used a well as a fallback font if the browser is not compatible with the fonts.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organization.

  1.  Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a “Shop” Call to action button. The Text’s font size and the way it is presented on different devices has been styled accordingly for better readability.
  2.  The main points are made immediately with the hero image and text provided.
  3.  The navigation bar has the “About” link that scrolls the user down to the About section for more information about the company and what they’re trying to achieve. Under “Our Mission” section the company’s ethos is described.

- I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.
-__1 TransparenT 600px and down ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-___2 

  1.  The users have three options:

      1.  Click the call to action button that takes them directly to the Shop page.
      2.  Click on the navigation bar items that takes them to their section of choice. On smaller devices clicking on the burger icon drops down the hidden navigation items. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page/section they will end up at clearly. At the bottom clicking on the logo icon scrolls the users smoothly back to the top of the page, alongside with the social media icons to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn’t feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
      3.  Scroll down to explore the different website’s sections.

  2.  I want to be able to find information about the products.

      1.  Upon scrolling down, the first thing the user sees is what a Coffee researcher had to say about the Yemeni coffee.
      2.  In the same section the products names are displayed with a brief and pleasing description that makes the user want to know more. Hight quality images of the different types of Coffee beans are also presented next to the description. Products are presented Horizontally on bigger screens and Vertically on smaller devices.
      3.  A “More” call to action button redirects the user to the Shop page for more information about the products.
      4.  In the Shop page, 4 high quality images for each product and its packaging are presented in a slideshow window with a next and previous button to freely browser the images.
      5.  More information is shown about the products, such as the price, availability, and the flavor profile. Also, in this section the Products are presented Horizontally on bigger screens and Vertically on smaller devices.

  3.  I want to be able to buy the products.

      1.  In the Shop page, and as the website has been created only using HTML5 and CSS3, the user won’t be able to buy the product just yet as that requires JavaScript coding and backend technologies. So, the products have been listed with red-bold text to grab the user’s attention immediately as “Out of Stock” for the moment and the price stroke out. But instead a “Sign Up” call to action button asks the user to sign up to be informed once the product becomes available for purchase.
      2.  Upon clicking the “Sign-Up” button, a Sign-Up form emerges as a small pop-up screen window with a “Thank you for signing up” message and the required information fields to be filled out and also a submit button.

          1.  The pop-up window is responsive on different devices and appears with a slightly transparent background. Also, it is styled to appear around the middle of the screen.
          2.  By trying to submit and empty form, missing field or invalid email address, an error message is verified to appear.
          3.  By submitting the form with valid inputs, the page reloads as the form is not linked to any database.

  4.  I want to learn more about the relation of Yemen to the coffee industry.

      1.  As part of the About section, content of few paragraphs copied from an article is placed under “History” that gives the user better understanding on why the company has chosen to feature the Yemeni coffee.
      2.  Link to the original article is proposed under the content if the user wanted to learn more. This link opens in a new Tab window so that the user’s experience won’t be interrupted.

  5.  I want to see pictures that tell more to the story and purpose of the website.

      1.  Under the About section, a small collection of photos from the country and it’s coffee production are displayed in a full width slideshow that runs automatically with a next and previous button to freely browser the images.
      2.  The height of the slideshow is set to be equal to that of the header background, to maintain the aesthetic feel and balance throughout the website.
      3.  KNOWN ISSUE: the choice of the images doesn’t represent the idea intended from this section. The lack of resources to a better and a wider verity of images from the country was the reason, as all the images used were copyright free images.

  6.  I want to be able to contact the organization for any questions I may have.

      1.  The navigation bar clearly highlights the “Contact Us” form.
      2.  Upon clicking the “Contact Us” link, a Contact Us form emerges as a pop-up screen window with a “We’d like to hear from you” message and the required information fields to be filled out and also a submit button.

          1.  The pop-up window is responsive on different devices and appears with a slightly transparent background. Also, it is styled to appear around the middle of the screen.
          2.  By trying to submit and empty form, missing field or invalid email address, an error message is verified to appear.
          3.  By submitting the form with valid inputs, the page reloads as the form is not linked to any database.

  7.  I want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

      1.  The user can scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
      2.  Upon clicking on the preferred social media icon, the user is redirected to the login page of that social media platform as the company is only imaginary. This link opens in a new Tab window, so it won’t interrupt the user’s experience.

  8.  I want to sign up to the Newsletter, so I am emailed any updates/ discounts about the products.

      1.  At the bottom of every page there is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
      2.  In the middle of the footer the user can see “The Latest” and is prompted to Enter their email address.
      3.  There is a red “Subscribe” button to the right-hand side of the input field that can easily be distinguished.

          1.  This button appears centered and underneath the input field on smaller devices.
          2.  By trying to submit an empty or invalid email address, an error message is verified to appear.
          3.  By submitting the form with valid input, the page reloads as the form is not linked to any database.

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Opera browsers.
- The Website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung Galaxy A51, OnePlus 7.
- The Google Chrome browsers built-in DevTool was used to view and style the website on iPad Pro, iPad, iPhone X, iPhone 6/7/8 and the plus versions, and iPhone 5/SE
- Testing was done to ensure that pages link correctly, and that the layout of the content appeared in the most pleasing and clean-looking manner.
- Friends & Mentor were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or UX issues.

### Fixed bugs

- Mozilla Firefox browser had a problem with displaying the slideshow of the product images in the Shop page. Once every new image scrolls into place, the container would stretch out and stretch back in. The problem was in the class used for that container.
- The logo in the footer was disoriented. Resized the image and fixed its alignment to % instead of pixels.
- Sign up and contact form was too high up on the screen when using a mobile device. Added a top margin of 15% for better reach and usability.
- When the website is viewed using a mobile device with the screen being held horizontally, the Text and Motto of main page were overlapping the hero image, although they have been styled to appear to the right side of the cup on different screen sizes viewed vertically. I outlined the text with a 0.02 shadow to make it readable and stand out. Also did the same for the brand name for the overall better look of the page.
- The Subscribe button looked disoriented on the iPhone 5. Styled it according to that specific resolution.
