Hello world =)
Welcome to my portfolio. This repo contains a quick showcase of languages I work along with the usual resume to view and download as PDF which naturally include my work experience.
It was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Its is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap and some wow/animate.css ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
 
## UX (User Experience)
 This website is desigened to be responsive on a range of devices which is smooth to navigate for potential recruiters/customers and it showcases a developers skills, the main focus for the website’s owner is to present his knowledge in developing and manifest digital ideas to reality.
 Potential customers (recruiters) can request projects such as fully responsive front-end static website’s with the addition of back-end functionality, another project can be a mobile application as well.

- ### User stories

  - As a website user or as a recruiter, I want to effortlessly understand the main purpose of the website & understand more about what the developer is offering.
  - To be able to effortlessly navigate throughout the website to find the right content.
  - To be able to find information about the projects.
  - To be able to contact with the developer for any inquires.
  - To be able to see my picture that connectes the user with me and brings friendliness to the website.
  - To be able to know about the background of the developer.
  - To be able to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine the developers echo across the web.

- ### Design

  - #### Image:

    - So I was debating between putting my picture in the hero body or not, But after I asked my friends and got random feedback from them, plus I searched online and realized that is what people really wanted to see as well in a portfolio and to just get to know me more as a person.
      And nowadays as almost 85% of jobs are applied online, where usually there's no opportunity to physically present my face in front of recruiters at the company, the picture really helps.
      So I reluctantly added my picture to the hero-body. We live in an age with no people judgments can form just based on gender, age and ethnicity, So I'm happy it's there and I hope you like it.

  - #### Color:

    - The color used are colormap linear gradient of the color schemes purple, white and blue and at most of the design purple is the color progression dominant.
      I choose the color purple because it's often assosiated with wisdom, creativity and magic.Purple as well is the balancing color between red and blue’s color psychologies, and while red brings energy to the color, blue brings relaxation and stability, together they make purple the perfect balance of the two.
      [Color Psychology](http://www.artitudesdesign.com/purple-color-psychology/) says that it “can have calming effects over the mind and nerves, it can be uplifting and can trigger creativity.”
    - Color inspired from [dribble](https://dribbble.com).

  - #### Typography:
    - The sexy fonts used within the website are Exo and Roboto fonts. Sans Serif font is used a well as a fallback font if the browser is not compatible with the fonts.
